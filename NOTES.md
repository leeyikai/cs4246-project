# Notes

**parse_orb** will return the observable state with the cell is currently in

## Cell Data
boost_x, boost_y, radius, log_radius, position_x, position_y, relative_position_x, relative_position_y, canRemerge, ismycell
boost_x = horizontal split velocity when splitting
boost_y = vertical split velocity when splitting
radius = radius of cell
log_radius = log radius of cell
position_x, position_y = position (absolute)
relative_position_x, relative_position_y = position (relative to the view that the user has)
canRemerge = whether cell can remerge
ismycell = whether cell is the player's cell
